# Langton's Ant in Nim

This program just outputs a simulation of Langton's ant, on a 100x100 grid, with the ant initialised at the centre pointing up.
The simulation terminates when the ant hits the wall of the grid.

I wrote this just to test out Nim, so it's not very feature complete, but here it is!
